# Phishing-Email-Analysis
This documentation outlines the process of analysing a phishing email sample for educational and cybersecurity training purposes. The phishing email used in this report was obtained from the phishing_pot repository on GitHub. Phishing-pot contains publicly available phishing email samples intended solely for research, awareness, and safe analysis.
The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate how to properly investigate suspicious emails using various open-source tools and analytical techniques, including header analysis, URL analysis, IP reputation checks, and email security validation.
